# Overview
## About the Project

The goals of this project are as follows:
- Create reliable regression models that can accurately, with certain windows, MSE, RMSE, and MAE values of less than < 2 (this can change) to ensure proper predictions
- These models will work on datasets that are discrete, AKA, data that was taken from a screenshot of time.
- Compare Baseline models against a deep learning model (i.e: Preferably an attention model, but if we encounter difficulty, we will opt for an RNN family model).

Non Goals:
- We will not be predicting future prices of oil and gold on streaming data environments; this is in a static, continuous environment.
- The Dataset was purposely chosen to align with two assets correlated with today’s economic assets; we will not explore any other tickers.
- Depending on how it goes, we will explore for sure linear regression, multi-linear regression, and a deep learning model, but 3 models is the objective. Not 9 or 10.
